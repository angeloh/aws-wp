== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do users login to chat? =

Envolve provides Single Sign On, so that users who already have accounts on your site are automatically logged into chat. Users who are not logged into your site can login with Facebook, Twitter, or chat anonymously if you would like to allow that. You also have the option of restricting chat to only be displayed to users who are logged into your site.

= Does this cost money? =

A free, ad-supported version is available for up to 25 simultaneous chatters. Paid versions are available for larger sites and for sites that want to remove Envolve's branding from the product. Pricing information is available [here](https://www.envolve.com/pricing.html?utm_source=WPDirectory&utm_medium=infopage&utm_campaign=infopage&install_type=wordpress).

= What is public and what is private? =

*   Group chats (those created with the new chat button) are visible to everyone who comes to the site.
*   Private chats (those created by clicking 'chat' next to a name) are only visible to the participants.

= Will my BuddyPress users' pictures show up in chat? =
Yes. This is a new feature as of version 2.1 of the plugin.

= What info will Envolve use? =

We will never share messages sent in private chats. Public chat transcripts are available to site owners. See our [privacy policy](https://www.envolve.com/privacy.html?utm_source=WPDirectory&utm_medium=infopage&utm_campaign=infopage&install_type=wordpress).
